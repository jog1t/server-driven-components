# Reactive Server Components - Project Notes

**Date Started:** 2026-01-04
**Prototype Goal:** Extend React Server Components with server-initiated updates (server-driven UI)

---

## 🎯 Core Concept

Standard React Server Components (RSC) follow a **client-pull** model:
- Server components render on the server
- Client requests updates when needed (via user interaction)
- Bundler handles the coordination

**Our Innovation:** Add a **server-push** model where the server can proactively update components.

### Use Cases
- Live dashboards
- Real-time notifications
- Collaborative editing
- Live data feeds (stock prices, analytics)
- Server-driven UI state changes

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Decisions

### 1. Framework Stack
- **Framework:** Waku (minimal RSC framework)
  - **Why:** Built on Hono + Vite, uses @vitejs/plugin-rsc
  - **Benefit:** Waku uses Hono underneath, perfect for SSE integration
  - **Access:** `waku/unstable_hono` provides Hono instance access

- **Server:** Hono (via Waku)
  - **Why:** Lightweight, fast, Web Standards API
  - **Benefit:** Built-in to Waku, no additional server needed

- **Transport:** Server-Sent Events (SSE)
  - **Why:** Unidirectional server→client push, simpler than WebSockets
  - **Benefit:** Built into browsers (EventSource API), HTTP-based
  - **Trade-off:** Unidirectional only (can be changed to WebSockets later)

### 2. Simplicity Choices (for prototype)
- **Reactivity trigger:** Event-based (server state changes)
- **Component granularity:** Global stream (all reactive components update together)
- **Multi-client:** Broadcast to all connected clients
- **Demo complexity:** Simple counter/clock that updates from server

### 3. Future-Proofing Considerations
- **Framework-agnostic goal:** Architecture should be portable
- **Current decision:** Prototype with Waku, abstract later if successful
- **Abstraction points:**
  - SSE transport layer (can swap to WebSockets)
  - RSC rendering mechanism (can work with other RSC frameworks)
  - Reactive component marker (can become a standard hook/API)

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Base Waku Setup ✓
1. Initialize Waku project
2. Verify Hono access via `waku/unstable_hono`
3. Create basic server/client component structure

### Phase 2: Standard RSC Components
Components to demonstrate:
- **2-3 Client Components** (interactive, "use client")
  - Counter with button
  - Interactive form/toggle
  - Display component with state

- **Server Components** (demonstrate server-only features)
  - Server info display (Node version, timestamp at render)
  - Mock data fetch (simulated API call)
  - Environment variable display (server-only)

- **Boundaries demonstration**
  - Server component passing props to client component
  - Client component with callback (server action)

### Phase 3: SSE Reactive Layer
**Server-side:**
1. Create SSE endpoint in Hono (`/api/reactive-stream`)
2. Implement event emitter for server state changes
3. Broadcast mechanism for reactive updates

**Client-side:**
1. EventSource connection to SSE endpoint
2. Listener for server events
3. Trigger RSC Payload refetch on event
4. Selective component re-render

**Protocol Design:**
```typescript
// SSE Event structure
{
  type: 'component-update',
  componentId?: string,  // Future: selective updates
  timestamp: number,
  payload?: any          // Optional data
}
```

### Phase 4: Reactive Server Component
**Implementation:**
- Create a "reactive marker" (convention or hook)
- Server component that opts into reactivity
- Server-side state that triggers updates (e.g., counter, clock)
- Demonstrate server-initiated re-render

**Example: Reactive Clock**
```tsx
// Server component that updates from server events
export default async function ReactiveClock() {
  const time = await getServerTime();
  return <div>Server Time: {time}</div>;
}
```

Server emits event every second → Client refetches → Component re-renders

## 🚧 Known Shortcuts & Trade-offs

### Shortcuts for Prototype
1. **Global updates:** All reactive components update together
   - **Future:** Component-specific subscriptions with IDs

2. **No persistence:** Server state is in-memory
   - **Future:** Connect to real data sources (DB, Redis, etc.)

3. **No error handling:** Minimal error boundaries
   - **Future:** Comprehensive error handling and retry logic

4. **No optimization:** Full component re-fetch on every update
   - **Future:** Incremental updates, diffing, caching

5. **No authentication:** Open SSE connection
   - **Future:** Auth tokens, session management

### Potential Issues to Monitor
- **Performance:** Full RSC Payload refetch may be expensive
  - **Solution:** Implement selective updates or streaming diffs

- **Connection management:** SSE reconnection on disconnect
  - **Solution:** Implement reconnection logic with exponential backoff

- **Scale:** Broadcasting to many clients
  - **Solution:** Use Redis pub/sub or message queue for multi-instance

- **Memory leaks:** EventSource cleanup on unmount
  - **Solution:** Proper cleanup in useEffect

## 🎓 Learning & Insights

### What Worked Well

1. **Waku's API Routes** - Incredibly simple to create SSE endpoints
   - Just export `GET` function from `src/pages/api/*.ts`
   - No need to manually access Hono or use `unstable_honoEnhancer`
   - Clean separation of concerns

2. **SSE Integration** - Surprisingly straightforward
   - Browser's EventSource API works flawlessly
   - ReadableStream API makes server-side streaming clean
   - No external libraries needed

3. **RSC Component Boundaries** - Clear and intuitive
   - Server components default (no directive needed)
   - `'use client'` directive makes client components obvious
   - Props flow naturally from server to client components

4. **Waku Build System** - Fast and reliable
   - Clean build output
   - Good error messages during development
   - Proper separation of client/server/SSE bundles

5. **React 19 + Waku** - Excellent developer experience
   - Async server components work perfectly
   - Suspense integration (though not fully explored yet)
   - React Compiler support out of the box

### What Didn't Work

1. **True Server Component Refetching** - Current limitation
   - Server components don't have a built-in "refetch" mechanism
   - Can't trigger server component re-render from SSE events directly
   - Workaround: Display SSE data in client wrapper instead

2. **Initial Documentation Confusion**
   - `unstable_honoEnhancer` wasn't well documented
   - Turned out we didn't need it (API routes were sufficient)
   - Lesson: Start with framework features before reaching for advanced APIs

3. **Static Rendering** - Had to change config
   - Initial config used `render: 'static'`
   - Changed to `render: 'dynamic'` for server components to work properly

### Key Learnings

1. **SSE is Perfect for Server-Push** (for this use case)
   - Unidirectional is sufficient for server-driven UI
   - HTTP-based means better compatibility
   - No need for WebSocket complexity yet

2. **The "Reactive Wrapper" Pattern**
   - Client component wraps server component
   - Client maintains SSE connection
   - Client displays both: server-rendered content + live SSE data
   - **Limitation:** Not true server component refetching, but proves the concept

3. **True Reactive RSC Would Require:**
   - Framework-level support for component subscriptions
   - Mechanism to trigger RSC payload refetch
   - Possibly: `router.refresh()` or similar API
   - Or: Streaming RSC updates over the same SSE connection

4. **Waku API Routes Discovery**
   - Files in `src/pages/api/` become API endpoints automatically
   - Export HTTP method handlers: `GET`, `POST`, etc.
   - Return standard `Response` objects
   - This was the key to simple SSE implementation!

5. **Prototype vs Production Gap**
   - Current implementation proves the UX concept
   - Production would need: error handling, reconnection, auth, scaling
   - But the core idea works: server can drive UI changes via SSE

### Future Directions

#### Short-term (Next Iteration)
- Implement router.refresh() or navigation-based refetch
- Add proper error boundaries and reconnection logic
- Explore Waku's server actions for bidirectional updates
- Test with multiple concurrent clients

#### Medium-term (Framework Enhancement)
- Create a `useReactiveServer` hook for cleaner API
- Implement component-specific subscriptions (not global)
- Add developer tools for debugging reactive updates
- Explore streaming RSC payloads over SSE

#### Long-term (Framework-Agnostic)
- Extract pattern into standalone library
- Support multiple RSC frameworks (Next.js, Remix, etc.)
- Standardize protocol for reactive server components
- Publish findings and gather community feedback

### Open Questions

1. **Can we stream RSC payloads over SSE?**
   - Instead of refetching, stream component updates directly
   - Would require deep integration with React Flight format
   - Potentially more efficient than full refetch

2. **How to handle partial updates?**
   - Sending full component tree vs incremental diffs
   - JSON Patch or similar diffing strategy?
   - Trade-off: complexity vs bandwidth

3. **Multi-instance deployment?**
   - Current: In-memory state, single server
   - Future: Redis pub/sub for horizontal scaling
   - How to maintain consistent SSE connections?

4. **Developer Experience**
   - How do developers mark components as "reactive"?
   - Convention-based (file name/location)?
   - Explicit API (`export const reactive = true`)?
   - Hook-based (`useServerPush()`)?

### v0.2.0 - Component-Specific Signals (2026-01-04) ✅ COMPLETED

#### Goal
Move from global interval-based updates to **component-specific reactive signals** with server-side state management.

#### User Requirements
```tsx
// Desired API
export async function ReactiveComponent() {
  const [value, setValue] = await useSignal();

  await useServerEffect(async () => {
    const interval = setInterval(() => {
      setValue(Date.now());
    }, 3000);

    return () => clearInterval(interval);
  }, []);

  return <p>Current server time is: {value}</p>;
}
```

#### Implementation

**1. Server-Side State Management**
- Created `ServerStateManager` class (`lib/server-state-manager.ts`)
  - Manages state per component ID
  - Tracks effect cleanups
  - Handles SSE subscriptions
  - Notifies subscribers on state changes

**2. "Hook-like" APIs** (`lib/server-hooks.ts`)
- `useServerSignal(id, key, initial)` - Server-side state (like useState)
- `useServerEffect(id, effect, deps)` - Server-side effects (like useEffect)
- `initReactiveComponent(id, setup)` - Component initialization
- `cleanupReactiveComponent(id)` - Component cleanup

**3. Component-Specific SSE**
- Updated `/api/reactive-stream` to accept `?componentId=...` query param
- Each component gets its own SSE stream
- Server notifies only subscribed clients for that component

**4. Enhanced ReactiveWrapper**
- Now requires `componentId` prop
- Connects to component-specific SSE endpoint
- Displays live server state for that component
- Optional `showDebug` prop to hide debug UI

**5. Demo Components**
- `ServerClock` - Updates every 1 second
- `ServerCounter` - Configurable increment and interval
- Demonstrated 3 reactive components with different update rates

#### Achievements
- ✅ Component-specific reactive updates (not global)
- ✅ Server-side state management
- ✅ Server-side lifecycle management
- ✅ Multiple components with different update rates
- ✅ Clean hook-like API for developers
- ✅ Build successful (no errors)

#### API Example
```tsx
// Define reactive server component
export async function ServerClock({ reactiveId }: { reactiveId: string }) {
  const [time, setTime] = await useServerSignal(reactiveId, 'time', new Date().toISOString());

  await useServerEffect(reactiveId, async () => {
    const interval = setInterval(() => {
      setTime(new Date().toISOString());
    }, 1000);

    return () => clearInterval(interval);
  }, []);

  return <div>Server time: {new Date(time).toLocaleTimeString()}</div>;
}

// Wrap with ReactiveWrapper
<ReactiveWrapper componentId="server-clock-1">
  <ServerClock reactiveId="server-clock-1" interval={1000} />
</ReactiveWrapper>
```

#### Current Limitations
- **Manual component IDs** - Developer must provide unique ID
- **No automatic initialization** - Components initialize on first render
- **No cleanup on client disconnect** - Effects continue running
- **In-memory state only** - No persistence (Redis, etc.)
- **Still not true RSC refetch** - State displayed in client wrapper

#### What Works
- ✅ Per-component state management
- ✅ Server-driven updates via SSE
- ✅ Multiple components with independent timers
- ✅ Clean separation of concerns
- ✅ Scalable architecture (can add Redis later)

#### What's Next
- [ ] Automatic component ID generation
- [ ] Client disconnect detection and cleanup
- [ ] Persistent state storage (Redis)
- [ ] True RSC payload refetching
- [ ] Error boundaries and reconnection logic
